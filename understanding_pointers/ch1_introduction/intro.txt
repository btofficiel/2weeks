Three types of memory
---------------------
| Static | -> allocated when program starts and remains in existence until it terminates. Scope limited to defining function.

| Automatic | -> Created when a function is called. Lifetime limited till function is executing.

| Dynamic | -> Allocated from heap and can be released.
