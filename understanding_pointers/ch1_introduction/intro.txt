---------------------
Three types of memory
---------------------
| Static | -> allocated when program starts and remains in existence until it terminates. Scope limited to defining function.

| Automatic | -> Created when a function is called. Lifetime limited till function is executing.

| Dynamic | -> Allocated from heap and can be released.

--------
Pointers
--------

// A pointer variable contains the address in memory of another variable, object , or function. 

// Nothing inherent in a pointer indicates what type of data the pointer is referencing

Lvalues
-------

// Lvalues refers to the operand found on the left side of the assignment operator.

// Lvalue refers to a storage location

// All lvalues are modifiable

---------------
Concept of NULL
---------------

// When NULL is assigned to a pointer it means the pointer points to nothing.

// Two null pointers will always be equal.

// The NULL macro is a constant integer zero cast to a pointer as follows:-
// #define NULL (((void *)0)

// ASCII NUL is defined as a byte containing all zeros

// NULL should not be used in contexts other than pointers

// A pointer to void is a general purpose pointer used to hold references to any data type.

// Pointers to void are used for data pointers, not function pointers.


// Both global and static pointers exist till the program terminates but static pointers' scope is limited to the block they are declared in.
