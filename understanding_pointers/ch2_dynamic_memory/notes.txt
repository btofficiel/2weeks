Dynamic Memory allocation in C
------------------------------
 -> Use a malloc type fucntion to allocate memory.
 -> Use this memory to support the application.
 -> Deallocate the memory using free function.
 

 // When memory is allocated, additional information is stored in a data structure which contains block size and other data.

-> The memory's address is lost.
-> The free fucntion is never invoked though it should be (sometimes called a hidden leak).
